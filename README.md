Grid search(machine learning)
1>The code is built on google colab with python3 and GPU supoort. Make sure all the packages imported in the code are installed. They come pre-installed in google colab.
2>The dataset used can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data.
3>There are three main functions defined other than main. They are read_data, preprocess_and_split_data, classification_report_gen.
4>No user input is required to run this code.
5>11 classification models were used in this code.
a> Decision Tree
b> Neural Network
c> SVM
d> Gaussian Naive Bayes
e> Logistic Regression
f> k-Nearest Neighbors
g> Bagging
h> Random Forest
i> AdaBoost Classifier
j> Gradient Boosting Classfier
k> XGBoost
6>Code takes about an hour to run.
